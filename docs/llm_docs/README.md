# PySnap Documentation for LLM Training

This comprehensive documentation covers the PySnap project for LLM training and knowledge testing purposes.

## Documentation Structure

### High-Level Overview
- `architecture/` - System architecture, design patterns, and overall framework structure
- `modules/` - Detailed documentation for each major module (snapy_capture, snapy_testing)
- `files/` - Individual file documentation with detailed API and implementation notes
- `examples/` - Usage patterns, integration examples, and real-world scenarios
- `api-reference/` - Complete API reference with all classes, methods, and functions

### Key Components Documented

**snapy_capture Framework**
- Automatic function argument capture using decorators
- Configurable storage system with pickle serialization
- Security-focused argument filtering
- Production-safe configuration management
- Integration patterns with existing codebases

**snapy_testing Framework**
- Function call tracing using sys.settrace
- Comprehensive execution flow capture
- Integration with syrupy snapshot testing
- Advanced tracing decorators and context managers
- Performance analysis and call graph generation

### Learning Objectives

This documentation enables understanding of:
1. Decorator-based argument capture patterns in Python
2. Advanced sys.settrace implementation techniques
3. Production-ready testing framework design
4. Security considerations in testing tools
5. Performance optimization in tracing systems
6. Integration strategies for legacy codebases

### Documentation Usage

Each documentation file includes:
- Detailed technical explanations
- Code examples with full context
- Security and performance considerations
- Integration patterns and best practices
- Common pitfalls and troubleshooting
- Testing strategies and validation approaches

This comprehensive coverage supports thorough understanding testing and knowledge validation of the PySnap framework.
